google-docs-spreadsheets
========================

A Clojure library designed to interact with google spreadsheets

Setup
-----

Since the gdata libs are in a zip you will have to download them and install
them locally, the ones you need are the ones specified in the project
dependencies (project.clj) they are under java/lib and java/deps in the zip
that you can download from here:

http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/downloads/list

then install lein localrepo plugin and run::

    for i in $PWD/*.jar; do lein localrepo install $(lein localrepo coords $i); done 

on a folder where all the required dependency jars are located

Usage
-----

see google-docs-spreadsheets-cli for sample usage in code, it includes a cli
that you can run using lein run, if ran without arguments it will:

* ask for username and password
* list all the documents available
* ask you to pick one by number
* list all the worksheets of that document
* ask you to pick one and then dump all the cells from (0, 0) to (10, 10) to
  the output

if you provide spreadsheet id and worksheet id it will dump the cells like the
last step above.

examples::

    # spreadsheet dump
    lein run -- -s tBp80BiVqx6-WqTyqgP8imi -w od6 -u user@gmail.com -p 'secret'

    # step by step selection
    lein run

    # step by step selection specifying username and password
    lein run -- -u user@gmail.com -p 'secret'
